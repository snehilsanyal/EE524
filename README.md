## Welcome to EE524 (Jul-Nov 2020)
Hello friends... Hope you are safe and sound.

I hope you are all excited to learn about Machine Learning. In this semester, you must be going through the Machine Learning Course offerred by Professor [Manas Kamal Bhuyan](https://www.iitg.ac.in/mkb/) sir. 

This is the official course webpage for the course EE524 Machine Learning Laboratory which will complement the course Introduction to Machine Learning. We will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) an open source software to run our codes.


```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
```


As mentioned, in the [instruction manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WB9rOMm190cqKGt-76TFDTX6vgbtsUts/view?usp=sharing) we will also use libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Scikit-Learn.

### Objectives of this lab:
1. Learn about the concepts in Machine Learning from data generation, handling, preprocessing.
2. Learn about different algorithms in Machine Learning.
3. Improve coding skills in Python.
4. Implement these concepts on your own.
5. Create something as an outcome of this lab course.


### Lab evaluation Structure:
- **Continuous Evaluations:** 50 Marks (Through Assignments)
- **Viva:** 20 Marks (After all submissions)
- **Mini Project:** 30 Marks (Will be given after 6th Lab Session)


### Timeline:
We have a total of 12 labs in this session. Everything will be online due to the pandemic. We will try to complete most of the important algorithms required for you to have a good background in Machine Learning. We will be pushing assignments, have doubt sessions and will evaluate your assignments. Assignments will be weekly.
